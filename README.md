### Current status

+ Tested with Vitis AI&trade; 3.5 and TensorFlow 2.16
+ Tested on the following platforms: ZCU102, Kria KV260


## Introduction

This repository update of the official [AMD Vitis AIâ„¢ tutorial](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI-Tutorials/blob/1.4/Design_Tutorials/02-MNIST_classification_tf). It guides users through the Vitis AI development flow (using Tensorflow), accelerating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deploying them on AMD development platforms for inference (prediction). The updates bring the tools to the latest version (2024) and add support for CIFAR-10 dataset classification.

The provided scripts are written in Bash and Python and use VART runtime.

The updated tutorial is divided into the following 3 + 1 steps:

+ Setup of the development environment and definition of environment variables;
+ Definition, training, quantization, and evaluation of a small CNN using TensorFlow 2.16;
+ Compilation of the quantized model to obtain the .xmodel file executable on the DPU accelerator;
+ Deployment of the compiled model on ZCU102 and/or Kria KV260 and execution of the application that handles inference.

Prerequisites:

Familiarity with Python3, TensorFlow, and basic machine learning principles.


## Shell Scripts in this Tutorial

+ ``0_setenv.sh`` : Sets necessary environment variables. You can edit most variables to configure the environment for your own requirements. It is recommended to leave CALIB_IMAGES set to 1000 for proper quantization calibration.

+ ``1_train.sh``: Runs training, quantization (``vai_q_tensorflow quantize``) and evaluation of the network, saveing the trained and quantized model as .h5 file.

+ ``2_compile_kv260.sh``: Compiles the quantized model into a .xmodel file for the Kria KV260 platform using the `vai_c_tensorflow`` command.

+ ``2_compile_zcu102.sh``: Compiles the quantized model into a .xmodel file for the ZCU102 evaluation board using the `vai_c_tensorflow`` command.

+ ``3_make target_kv260.sh``: Copies the .xmodel and images to the ``./build/target_kv260`` folder for use with the Kria KV260 platform.

+ ``3_make target_zcu102.sh``: Copies the .xmodel and images to the ``./build/target_zcu102`` folder for use with the ZCU102 evaluation board.


## Datasets: MNIST and CIFAR-10 

The MNIST handwritten digits dataset is a publicly available dataset containing 70k 28x28 8-bit grayscale images. The complete dataset of 70k images is divided into 60k images for training and 10k images for validation. It's considered the 'hello world' of Machine Learning.

![mnist](./files/img/mnist.png?raw=true "Example MNIST images")

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used dataset consisting of 60k 32x32 color images divided into 10 different classes, each of which is represented by 6k images. The dataset is split into 50k training images and 10k test images. Widely used for benchmarking in computer vision and Machine Learning.

## The Convolution Neural Network

The updated flow includes two network architectures:

+ The original architecture for MNIST.
+ A slightly more complex architecture for CIFAR-10.

Both networks are described in the ``customcnn.py`` script.


## Image pre-processing

The images undergo simple pre-processing before being used for training, evaluation, and quantization calibration. All images are normalized to bring pixel values into the range of 0 to 1 by dividing by 255.

## Setup the host machine

The host machine must meet several requirements:

+ Ubuntu 20.04 or later
+ At least 100GB of free disk space
+ A CPU or GPU version of the Vitis AI docker

NVIDIA GPU (<= CUDA 11.8) is recommended.

For detailed system requirements and installation instructions, refer to the [Vitis AI documentation](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis-AI/3.5/html/docs/reference/system_requirements.html).

Step 1: Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu

1. Uninstall any existing Docker versions:

```shell
"for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done"
```

2. Set up Docker's apt repository:

```shell
# Add Docker's official GPG key
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources
echo \
"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) \
signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] \
https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
sudo apt-get update
```

3. Install the Docker packages:

```shell
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

4. Verify Docker Engine installation:

```shell
sudo docker run hello-world
```

For more information, refer to the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

Step 2: Install CUDA

The following steps referred to hosts with NVIDIA GPU, for a CPU or ROCm installation refer to the [Vitis AI documentation](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis-AI/3.5/html/docs/reference/system_requirements.html).

For NVIDIA GPUs, ensure NVIDIA drivers and the Container Toolkit are correctly installed:

1. Install NVIDIA drivers:

```shell
sudo ubuntu-drivers install
```

2. Configure the repository:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
sudo apt-get update

```

3. Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit packages:

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
```

4. Verify the installation with the ``nvidia-smi`` command:

```shell
nvidia-smi
```

The output should indicate the successful activation of the driver and installation of CUDA. It should appear similar to the below:

```shell
